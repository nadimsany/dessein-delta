					 <h4> Use Of Warm And Cool Colors In Logo Design </h4> 
					 <img src="Image/logo.jpg"  alt="post image"/>
					 <p> Graphic designers lay so much emphasis on the right selection of colors when designing a logo. This is because the human mind is sensitive to visuals and responds quickly to what it sees. Colors strike our minds either consciously or subconsciously. So, the message from the color is any way registered in our mind. Remember that the message may be positive or negative.For example, if a logo evokes some passion, it is the message it wants to convey to the viewers. But if the designer wrongly uses a different color, that too will evoke a wrong emotion. Such a logo will not be able to target customers. But the viewers will get a message, though it will not be the one a company wanted. </p>
